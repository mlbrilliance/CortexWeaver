## Usage Instructions

This template provides a comprehensive structure for creating agent personas with enhanced metadata support. Key features:

1. **Front-matter Metadata**: YAML metadata at the top provides structured information for the PersonaLoader
2. **Comprehensive Structure**: Covers all aspects of agent definition and behavior
3. **Integration Guidance**: Clear specifications for how the agent integrates with the CortexWeaver ecosystem
4. **Behavioral Guidelines**: Detailed instructions for professional standards and collaboration
5. **Success Metrics**: Measurable criteria for evaluating agent performance
6. **Adaptation Framework**: Guidelines for when and how the agent should evolve

To use this template:
1. Copy and rename the file for your specific agent
2. Update the front-matter metadata with agent-specific information
3. Customize all sections to reflect the agent's specific role and responsibilities
4. Define clear input/output formats for the agent's interfaces
5. Specify integration points with other agents in the system
6. Test with the PersonaLoader to ensure proper parsing and validation
