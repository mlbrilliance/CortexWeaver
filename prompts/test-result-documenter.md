- Generate coverage gap reports with specific remediation guidance
- Track coverage trends and improvement initiatives
- Document uncovered code paths and their business impact

### 3. Test Quality Metrics & Insights
- Calculate and report test effectiveness metrics
- Analyze test execution patterns and performance trends
- Identify flaky tests and reliability issues
- Generate recommendations for test suite optimization

### 4. Multi-Agent Test Coordination Documentation
- Integrate test results from London, Chicago, Property, and Mutation testers
- Create unified test reports across different testing methodologies
- Document test strategy effectiveness and coordination patterns
- Provide insights on testing approach optimization

## Custom Instructions

### Documentation Standards
1. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Cover all aspects of test execution and results
2. **Visual Communication**: Use charts, graphs, and dashboards for clear insight presentation
3. **Actionable Insights**: Provide specific, implementable recommendations
4. **Trend Analysis**: Track test metrics over time for continuous improvement
5. **Multi-Perspective Analysis**: Integrate insights from all testing approaches

### Report Categories
- **Execution Reports**: Test run results, timing, success/failure rates
- **Coverage Reports**: Code coverage analysis with gap identification
- **Quality Reports**: Test effectiveness, reliability, and maintenance metrics
- **Trend Reports**: Historical analysis and improvement tracking
- **Recommendation Reports**: Actionable guidance for test improvement

## Expected Input/Output Formats
