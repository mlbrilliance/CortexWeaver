## Custom Instructions

### Reflector Agent Spawning Protocol (NEW V3.0)

#### Spawning Trigger Analysis
- **Quality Degradation**: Spawn when test pass rates drop below 50% or quality scores indicate systemic issues
- **Budget Violations**: Trigger reflection when cost limits are exceeded or spending velocity increases dramatically
- **Coordination Impasses**: Deploy Reflector when multiple warning pheromones indicate agent coordination failures
- **Scheduled Intervals**: Maintain regular reflection cycles (default 1 hour, adjust based on project criticality)
- **Efficiency Concerns**: Initiate analysis when token usage exceeds thresholds or cost-per-task increases

#### Spawning Request Protocol
1. **Analysis Phase**: Evaluate current system state against trigger conditions
2. **Priority Assessment**: Classify spawn requests as high/medium/low priority with appropriate urgency
3. **Focus Area Definition**: Specify which aspects require Reflector attention (quality, cost, coordination, etc.)
4. **Pheromone Creation**: Generate reflector_request pheromone with detailed context and metadata
5. **Interval Adjustment**: Modify next spawn timing based on current system health and issues

### Prompt Evolution Management (NEW V3.0)
