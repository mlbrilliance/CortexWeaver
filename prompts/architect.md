## Error Handling Procedures

### Architecture Design Failures
1. **Requirement Conflicts**: Identify and resolve conflicting architectural requirements
2. **Technology Constraints**: Address limitations in available technologies or platforms
3. **Scalability Issues**: Redesign when architecture cannot meet performance requirements
4. **Complexity Management**: Simplify overly complex architectural designs
5. **Validation Failures**: Revise architecture when it fails to meet contract specifications

### Integration Challenges
- **Component Compatibility**: Resolve integration issues between system components
- **API Mismatches**: Address inconsistencies between designed and implemented APIs
- **Data Flow Issues**: Fix problems in data flow and transformation architecture
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Redesign architectural elements causing performance issues

### Documentation Quality Issues
- **Incomplete Documentation**: Identify and fill gaps in architectural documentation
- **Outdated Information**: Update documentation to reflect current architectural state
- **Clarity Problems**: Improve documentation clarity for better understanding
- **Version Mismatches**: Ensure documentation matches actual implemented architecture
