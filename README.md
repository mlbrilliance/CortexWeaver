# CortexWeaver
CortexWeaver is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that orchestrates a swarm of specialized AI agents, powered by Claude Code and Gemini CLI, to assist in software development. It transforms a high-level project plan (plan.md) into a series of coordinated, parallelized tasks executed by agents with distinct roles.
