# Testing Agents Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of four specialized testing agents for the CortexWeaver project.

## Implemented Agents

### 1. London Tester (Mockist Style) - `/src/agents/london-tester.ts`
**Role**: Behavior-driven unit testing with extensive mocking
**Key Features**:
- Tests behavior through interaction verification
- Mocks all dependencies for complete isolation
- Validates method calls, parameters, and call sequences
- Generates mock-based test strategies
- Identifies interaction patterns and collaboration testing

**Test Coverage**: `/tests/agents/london-tester.test.ts` (18 test cases)

### 2. Chicago Tester (Classicist Style) - `/src/agents/chicago-tester.ts`
**Role**: State-based testing with real objects
**Key Features**:
- Tests final outcomes and system state
- Uses real implementations when practical
- Focuses on end-to-end behavior verification
- Generates integration and workflow tests
- Validates business logic through state changes

**Test Coverage**: `/tests/agents/chicago-tester.test.ts` (20 test cases)

### 3. Property Tester - `/src/agents/property-tester.ts`
**Role**: Property-based testing with invariant validation
**Key Features**:
- Identifies mathematical and domain-specific invariants
- Generates diverse input combinations for edge case discovery
- Implements shrinking strategies for minimal failing cases
- Validates contracts, metamorphic relations, and round-trips
- Provides comprehensive input space coverage analysis

**Test Coverage**: `/tests/agents/property-tester.test.ts` (15 test cases)

### 4. Mutation Tester - `/src/agents/mutation-tester.ts`
**Role**: Test suite effectiveness auditing through mutation testing
**Key Features**:
- Runs mutation testing frameworks (Stryker, PITest, etc.)
- Analyzes mutation survivors to identify test gaps
- Calculates mutation scores and quality metrics
- Generates actionable test improvement recommendations
- Audits test suite's ability to detect real bugs

**Test Coverage**: `/tests/agents/mutation-tester.test.ts` (16 test cases)

## Architecture

All agents extend the base `Agent` class and follow the established patterns:
- Proper initialization with `AgentConfig`
- Task execution through `executeTask()` method
- Integration with Claude API for AI-powered test generation
- Progress reporting through Cognitive Canvas
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Key Capabilities

### London Tester
- Mock strategy generation based on dependency analysis
- Interaction sequence verification
- Error scenario testing with mock failures
- Test quality validation for mockist principles

### Chicago Tester
- State transition analysis
- Real object integration testing
- End-to-end workflow verification
- Final outcome validation

### Property Tester
- Invariant identification (mathematical, metamorphic, contract-based)
- Generator selection for different data types
- Edge case generation and coverage analysis
- Shrinking strategy definition

### Mutation Tester
- Framework detection (Stryker, PITest, etc.)
- Survivor analysis and test gap identification
- Mutation score calculation
- Test improvement recommendations

## Testing Status

All agents are implemented with comprehensive test suites following TDD principles:
- **Total Tests**: 69 test cases across 4 agents
- **Test Coverage**: All core functionality tested
- **Mock Usage**: Proper mocking of external dependencies
- **Error Handling**: Tests for both success and failure scenarios

The implementation successfully demonstrates the different testing philosophies:
- **London School**: Mockist, behavior-focused
- **Chicago School**: Classicist, state-focused  
- **Property-Based**: Invariant and edge-case focused
- **Mutation Testing**: Test quality audit focused

Each agent is kept under 500 lines as requested and includes comprehensive interfaces for their specialized testing approaches.
