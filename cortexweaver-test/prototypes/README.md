# CortexWeaver Prototypes Directory

This directory contains rapid prototypes, experiments, and proof-of-concept implementations for your CortexWeaver project. The prototyping phase allows for quick exploration of technical feasibility and design alternatives before formal contract creation.

## Purpose

The `/prototypes` directory serves several key purposes in the CortexWeaver development workflow:

- **Rapid Experimentation**: Test new ideas and approaches quickly
- **Technical Feasibility**: Validate technical assumptions before formal development
- **Design Exploration**: Explore different architectural and UI/UX approaches
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify potential issues early in the development process
- **Proof of Concept**: Demonstrate core functionality to stakeholders

## Directory Structure

```

├── README.md                  # This file - explains the prototyping system
├── features/                  # Feature prototypes and early implementations
├── experiments/               # Experimental code and research implementations
├── proofs-of-concept/        # POCs for core system functionality
├── spike-solutions/          # Time-boxed investigation solutions
├── technical-demos/          # Demonstrations of technical capabilities

```

## Workflow Integration

### 1. Pre-Contract Prototyping
- Create prototypes to explore technical solutions
- Test assumptions before writing formal contracts
- Validate performance and scalability concerns

### 2. Agent-Driven Prototyping
- **Prototyper Agent**: Creates initial implementations
- **Architect Agent**: Reviews and refines prototypes
- **Coder Agent**: Extracts patterns for formal implementation

### 3. Prototype to Production
- Successful prototypes inform contract specifications
- Validated approaches guide formal architecture decisions
- Lessons learned improve development velocity

## Best Practices

### Prototype Guidelines
- Keep prototypes simple and focused
- Document assumptions and limitations
- Time-box prototype development (spike solutions)
- Include README files explaining the prototype purpose

### Quality Standards
- Prototypes should be functional but not production-ready
- Focus on proving concepts, not code quality
- Include basic tests for core functionality
- Document what works and what doesn't

### Transitioning to Formal Development
- Extract successful patterns into formal contracts
- Document lessons learned in the main project plan
- Archive or clean up unsuccessful prototypes
- Use prototype insights to inform architecture decisions

## Getting Started

1. **Choose a subdirectory** based on your prototype type
2. **Create a focused prototype** that tests a specific assumption
3. **Document your findings** in the prototype's README
4. **Share results** with the development team
5. **Extract successful patterns** for formal implementation

See the template files in each subdirectory for examples and guidance.
